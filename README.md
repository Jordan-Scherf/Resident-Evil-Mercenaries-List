# Resident-Evil-Mercenaries-List
C++ Priority Q list demonstration on the Console
Celebrating the release of the Resident Evil remake, lets take a look back at the beloved game mode, "Mercenaries". Essentially, each mercenary gets points based on the type of monster they eliminate. 
This program simulates that game mode on the "points" side of it. Every time a mercenary gets an updated elimantion count, it gets an updated spot on the priority queue.
The priority queue is a max heap binary tree which is defined in the "PriorityQ.h" file. 
In main is an object defined as "merctype" which holds all the information needed to "rank" the mercenaries on the priorty queue.
If any issues/bugs are found, leave a comment.
